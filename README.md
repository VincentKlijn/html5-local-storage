# html5-local-storage
This repository includes 6 examples of html5 local storage functionality.

- local storage,
- multi-session local storage,
- session storage,
- offline session storage,
- webSQL (even though this is no longer supported by W3)
- indexedDB.

The index.html has links to each of the individual pages.

### The HTML
The HTML is heavily commented to make identifying the elements easy and to understand their function.

### The CSS
The CSS is heavily commented to explain the individual rules.

### The JavaScript
There is a small javascript library with general workhorse functions, among which a table object to build the html table with which we show the actual data.

Furthermore, each html file has a local script tag which holds all the JavaScript for that particular functionality. Normally this would also be put in an external file, but for demonstration purposes this seemed the best way to go.

All JavaScript is heavily commented, almost on a line-by-line basis, explaining what is going on.
